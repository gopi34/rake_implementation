Upgrading from an iPad 1 which served me well for over 5 years this is a different beast altogether. It is 44% brighter with a brilliant display and all benchmarks place it just below the Pro in processing, battery, brightness, pixel density etc. It is much lighter too. Amazon offered this product at a super discounted price in the Diwali sale, moreover there were no new updates coming for the older iPad and newer apps were not being installed so had to go for it. I was looking for a tablet for my mother, who had been using Amazon Kindle Fire HD -- people who already own a recent model of iPad may not like this version much as Apple has sacrificed a few of the latest features to sell this device at a competitive price. Then, I saw iPad 2017 at 21 K(minus cashback) during Amazon Diwali sale and bought it without any second thoughts. I've been using this more than two months now. A perfectly well-built, sturdy and functional tablet for all practical purposes. I'm a college student who uses this for reading and taking down notes. Necessary free App's like 'Documents' and 'Penultimate by Evernote' can handle these two tasks pretty well. Even while you're reading and you wanna search for something say, tutorial of something at YouTube or Tutorial Point, you can multitask from 'Documents' app by swiping left from right edge of your screen. Google apps such as Chrome and YouTube function well in multitasking jobs. Thanks to it's powerful A9 chip. I charge only weekly or twice a week if not much of gaming and video playback. The battery life and brightness of the product is awesome. This is the tablet that we've been looking for and the one that we deserve. Thanks Apple and Amazon for delivering happiness.

Value for money. The best tablet that is out there for the price offered. These are my observations:
- performance is superb, didn't noticed any lags while using apps (A9/64 bit magic).
- screen size is perfect for reading, found it much better than my iPad mini.
- multimedia functions are at par.
- priced right, really reasonable given what you are getting. I think it will definitely help in increasing the market cap of iPad, adding new customers.
- after first boot, it notifies for a ~75MB software patch, and the OS is updated to version 10.3.3.
- on a flip side, I didn't liked the glossy screen, a matt finish would have been nice.
- also, a generic complain for any metal-back device, such devices are not handy without a cover (slippery and cold), it is a compulsion that you have to buy one before you use the product. So IMO manufacturers should consider supplying a basic cover with such products.

It‚Äôs a great choice if you want to spend less and don‚Äôt need some of the fancier features like Apple Pencil .A really good, reliable tablet that‚Äôll suit most people‚Äôs needs. These are my ratings per category:
* Performance (normal usage) - 9/10
* Design - 9/10
* Sound - 8/10
* Camera - 7/10
* Battery (without 11.0.1 update) - 9/10
* Screen quality - 8/10
* Overall Build - 9/10
* Value for money - 9/10
This new iPad 2017 delivers faster performance and a brighter screen, at a price almost half that of iPad Pro. Great cohesion between the superior hardware, upgraded software and apps makes it fly (well almost :)). Of course it is a bit thicker and heavier than its siblings. In summary - Pro and Air 2 owners can skip this one, but for rest, the iPad 2017 is a must have all rounder tablet at a fantastic price. Overall, an excellent buy, worth the money (I got this for INR 24,853).
Must have for all tablet lovers, this is an awesome tablet for people who are budget and quality minded. The hardware specifications of this tablet is good enough to last for at least five more years. The software support that Apple provides is legendary and the applications that are in the Apple Store can't be found anywhere else. In comparison with an iPad Air2 /iPad Pro, this tablet suits well for a tight budget. The touch ID is good enough though it's first generation. The dual core 64 bit processor and 2GB RAM is good enough for using any application, 32 GB storage space is more than enough for a tablet, build quality of this product is as good as it gets. The 9.7 inch form factor is there from quite some time and most of the applications are designed for that form factor and so using them is such a pleasure on this tablet. The Retina display and resolution is natural and comfortable to watch. Battery takes up to 3.5 hours to charge fully and under normal usage will easily last for 4 days. I don't want to get into more hardware specifications, as there are many reviews on it.
Get a case for this tablet, I would suggest to go for a spigen case... I bought one myself.
I had a little concern with the amount price I paid. I paid 23,000 for this tablet on first week of October 2017, in the second week of October 2017, The price has dropped to 21,000; I feel sad üò≠ about that but other than that I'm enjoying my new Apple iPad. Watch out for a good price and go for it üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
